							<h2>About Sky</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Our precious Sky Bear was taken from us too soon on August 5th, 2024.</strong></p>
							<p>She was mauled and killed at Second Beach, Vancouver by another larger dog. The owner fled the scene with the dog and is now nowhere to be found.</p>
							<p>The family consisting of 3 young children witnessed the whole brutal attack ending with Sky laying lifeless after the larger dog finally released her. No one should ever have to experience trauma like this, let alone children.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Sky was always the life of every party. She had random fans sometimes from across the street run over just to say Hi and pet her!</p>
							<p>She would dance for you when she wanted food and be the biggest princess and rolls over expecting pets on her belly.</p>
							<p>The family's lives will never be the same.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>She also leaves behind her brother Zuma. Zuma has spent the past few days sitting around staring at her Sky Towers (Sky's play pen) wondering when shes coming back.</p>
							<p>At times when he hears someone mention Sky's name he runs around the house looking for her thinking she's returned.</p>
							<p>They are now on a manhunt to look for the owner and are using funds from a GoFundMe as a reward.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>They are also pushing to have the city and province change their by laws and regulations to better protect civilians from possible future dog attacks that are 100% preventable.</p>
							<p>The family will need all the help they can get to push this cause forward so that we can find <strong>JUSTICE FOR SKY</strong> as well as make a massive difference in our community to create a safe environment we can all coexist in.</p>
